Firstly for learning and getting knowledge about a subject that they are passionate about. The second reason and maybe the primary one is to get a career in something you like. That&#39;s also the reason why MDD thought it was a good idea to create a new alumni page for their graduates. An alumni page can work as a great advertisement for the education and the graduates of the education.<br /><br />This was my first project at Momkai, It was a special thing to work on an alumni page for Digital Design students when I myself were one. I still had my last couple of months left of my studies when I started working on this project. It gave me a personal connection to the project.</p><h5>Client</h5><p>Master Digital Design is a course at Amsterdam University. It&#39;s a master&#39;s program in Digital Design. So everything from Development, UI Design, UX Design, and animation.</p><h5>Brief</h5><p>1. Create an alumnipage where students can easily share their profiles in an attractive way. The alumni profiles should be able to have an image, bio, contact information, quote, video and links to the articles the students have written.<br /><br />2. Their alumni profiles should be connected to the articles they have written on the original Master Digital Design website.<br /><br />3. The university should be able to highlight students.</p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/daabf5c6-808c-477b-b885-2f569095282b_mobile.b81b6cb7.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"Mockup for mobileversion\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  <h5>My role </h5><p>My role in the project was primarily frontend development with some backend. I received help from my mentor Chris. He helped me write code that style-wise was more aligned to how the other developers at Momkai write code.</p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/d7389b20-2728-4060-8b5c-f6b2f2c63baf_laptop.d4f80f58.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"Mockup\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  <h5>Techstack</h5><p>We inherited the tech stack from the original site which used a combination between Twig and Craft. This project was the first real project I made with Twig(I rarely use PHP and when I do I often use blade for templating) so that was an interesting challenge.</p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/7417b488-165b-4d71-bfaa-d54f47288895_desktop.e38254e5.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"Desktopmockup\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  <h5>Main takeaways</h5><p>1. Triangles are hard to make responsive. Don&#39;t overdo it.<br /><br />2. You can&#39;t explain a CMS good enough for your client. If they can break the website they will do that, so write a long description and guide for the CMS.<br /><br />3. I had a lot of prejudice about Twig before I started to work with it, but now afterward I must say that I got positively surprised. It can be really smooth to work with.</p>"},"title":{"text":"Alumnipage good enough for design students."},"project_name":{"html":"<h3>Amsterdam University</h3>","text":"Amsterdam University"},"summary":[{"summary_title":{"text":"Type"},"summary_value":{"text":"Client work"}},{"summary_title":{"text":"Role"},"summary_value":{"text":"Frontend developer"}},{"summary_title":{"text":"Team"},"summary_value":{"text":"Momkai"}}],"category":{"text":"Frontend Development"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"uid":"amsterdam-university"}}}
