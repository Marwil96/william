Firstly for learning and getting knowledge about a subject that they are passionate about. The second reason and maybe the primary one is to get a career in something you like. That's also the reason why MDD thought it was a good idea to create a new alumni page for their graduates. An alumni page can work as a great advertisement for the education and the graduates of the education.\n\nThis was my first project at Momkai, It was a special thing to work on an alumni page for Digital Design students when I myself were one. I still had my last couple of months left of my studies when I started working on this project. It gave me a personal connection to the project.","spans":[]},{"type":"heading5","text":"Client","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Master Digital Design is a course at Amsterdam University.

Create an alumnipage where students can easily share their profiles in an attractive way.

Their alumni profiles should be connected to the articles they have written on the original Master Digital Design website.\n\n3. The university should be able to highlight students.","spans":[]},{"type":"image","url":"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/daabf5c6-808c-477b-b885-2f569095282b_mobile.b81b6cb7.png?auto=compress,format","alt":"Mockup for mobileversion","copyright":null,"dimensions":{"width":2500,"height":1659}},{"type":"heading5","text":"My role ","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"My role in the project was primarily frontend development with some backend.

Triangles are hard to make responsive. Don't overdo it.\n\n2. You can't explain a CMS good enough for your client.

I had a lot of prejudice about Twig before I started to work with it, but now afterward I must say that I got positively surprised. It can be really smooth to work with.","spans":[]}],"project_name":[{"type":"heading3","text":"Amsterdam University","spans":[]}],"title":[{"type":"heading1","text":"Alumnipage good enough for design students.","spans":[]}],"summary":[{"summary_title":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Type","spans":[]}],"summary_value":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Client work","spans":[]}]},{"summary_title":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Role","spans":[]}],"summary_value":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Frontend developer","spans":[]}]},{"summary_title":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Team","spans":[]}],"summary_value":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Momkai","spans":[{"start":0,"end":6,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.momkai.com/","target":"_blank"}}]}]},{"summary_title":[{"type":"heading5","text":"Link","spans":[]}],"summary_value":[{"type":"paragraph","text":"Link to website","spans":[{"start":0,"end":15,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://www.masterdigitaldesign.com/alumni","target":"_blank"}}]}]}],"category":[{"type":"heading6","text":"Frontend Development","spans":[]}],"_meta":{"uid":"amsterdam-university"}}}]}}},"pageContext":{"uid":"amsterdam-university","rootQuery":"\n  query PostBySlug($uid: String!) {\n    prismic {\n      allProjects(uid: $uid) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            project_content\n            project_name\n            title\n            summary {\n              summary_title\n              summary_value\n            }\n            category\n            _meta {\n              uid\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n"}}}
