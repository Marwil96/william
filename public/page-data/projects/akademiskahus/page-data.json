In size, it is Swedens&#39; second-largest property owner.</p><h5>My Role</h5><p>My role in the project was to do the UI/UX work so everything from interviewing to the finishing details on the design.</p><p></p><h3>Discover</h3><h5>Market research</h5><p>We started our entire process by doing market research to investigate if there were any other similar solutions on the market today. We noticed that many of Akademiska Hus competitors had applications where their customers could easily report property faults.</p><h5>Problem</h5><p>During our interviews, we noticed that it is hard for Akademiska Hus customer service staff to report property faults. Which lower the value of the service that Akademiska Hus provides (Property’s for campuses) for both the customer and the customers&#39; customer (students, teachers, etc.)</p><h5>Interviewing Result</h5><p>- You can not report faults easy on your phone.<br />- The reporting system on the Akademiska Hus website is difficult and annoying to use.<br />- You can not send an image with the report.<br />- You need to write in your personal information every time you report.<br />- Long response time between Akademiska Hus operating technicians and customer service staff.<br />- There is also no easy way to communicate your information to customers.</p><h5>Users</h5><p>We discussed which users we would prioritize to target this new service to and who would need it. We found that we would primarily need to solve the communication between Akademiska Hus – Customer/Tenants – Users/the people who use Akademiska Hus properties.</p><p></p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/99ae8570-3f89-47ae-9bdc-9b9794e0f40e_akademiskahus-1.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"Users\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  <p></p><h3>Exploration</h3><h5>Wireframing</h5><p>When we made the first wireframes we took into account that the users of the product would largely be non-technical. And that the product should feel just as natural for them as a hammer or a notebook.</p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/d7878cdc-2159-4949-aefc-dbfe2af15638_akademiskahus-2.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"Wireframe/userflow\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  <p></p><h5>User Testing</h5><p>During the user tests, we noticed that the users had problems reading the serif font face so we switched to the recognizable Roboto instead. We also understood that the users wanted it to be possible to open the faults you had reported without switching view so they quickly could read the faults.</p><h5>Solution</h5><p>To make it easier to report faults, we came up with a web app that you can use as a tool to report faults on the go. After discussion with both Akademiska Hus and their users we selected these five functions to be developed:<br />- Sending a picture with the faults form.<br />- Being able to quickly see your reported faults and their status (inactive, active, archived).<br />- Information about property interference and other information, which should be easily relayed if needed.<br />- It should be easy to find the contact information for the person who is responsible for the school you take care of.</p><p></p><h3>Design</h3><h5>Interface</h5><p>The application was created with 32px margins and 4 column layout. We used google material design 2.0 because we felt that it was a waste of time to create new elements.</p><h5>Onboarding</h5><p>We made a short tutorial for first-time users, to help them understand the meaning of the application.</p>\n    <p class=\" block-img\">\n      <img src=\"https://images.prismic.io/williammartinsson/80c91a53-4615-40bc-9057-7d1695c31a81_Akademiskahus-3.png?auto=compress,format\" alt=\"\" copyright=\"\">\n    </p>\n  "},"title":{"text":"Finding a balance between simplicity and versatility."},"project_name":{"html":"<h3>Akademiskahus</h3>","text":"Akademiskahus"},"summary":[{"summary_title":{"text":"Role"},"summary_value":{"text":"UX & UI Design","html":"<p>UX &amp; UI Design</p>"}},{"summary_title":{"text":"Client"},"summary_value":{"text":"Akademiska Hus","html":"<p>Akademiska Hus</p>"}},{"summary_title":{"text":"Type"},"summary_value":{"text":"Student work","html":"<p>Student work</p>"}}],"category":{"text":"UX-Research & Design"}}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"uid":"akademiskahus"}}}
