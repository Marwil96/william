My way of doing that was interviewing barbers and finding reports about the business on the internet.</p><h5>General Information</h5><p>In Sweden, 8500 hairdressing salons exist and they have an average of 3.8 employees. Which means that hairdressing salons are usually small businesses. 700kr is the average payment. 62% of Sweden&#39;s women dye their hair. Customers have great loyalty to their hairdresser, 54% of all men surveyed by LÂ´oreal have been with the same hairdresser for over two years. According to a British survey, the British people trust their hairdresser more than their priest or police.</p><h5>Market Research</h5><p>The biggest booking system that exists today is ItsPerfect. I made some tests on the system both by clicking through it myself but also by letting three users do it in front of me.</p><h5>Tech Research</h5><p>I chose to work in React because it is a component-based framework and I have previous experience with it.</p><h5>Testing Research</h5><p>My mentor recommended me to use HotJar for digital testing as a complement to ordinary user testing because it is easier to share and get a bigger testing group.</p>"}},"slice_type":"rich_text"},{"id":"0dea5591-3464-5854-93b4-43a95e993823","slice_type":"full_width_image","internal":{"type":"PrismicProjectBodyFullWidthImage"},"primary":{"image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#a8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/49949/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.png","srcSet":"/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/f054e/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.png 750w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/ae1c8/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.png 1080w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/d41bd/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.png 1366w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/49949/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.png 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/4f03f/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.webp 750w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/4f506/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.webp 1080w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/f0a0a/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.webp 1366w,\n/static/ef1093e9d7b457985b2e1c820ccd756b/07142/345eea0e-fed3-488e-98e5-d024eaa110c0_barberbooking-1.webp 1500w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":1}}}}}},{"id":"5facb11b-f730-562b-a08f-9379e04636b6","primary":{"text":{"html":"<h1>Prototyping</h1><h5>User flow</h5><p>I started sketching out which functions and views that were necessary to make the product work.

Because they needed to be as reusable as possible.</p><h5>Iteration</h5><p>With the help of the constant flow of feedback, I could make small changes quickly that I could later show again and get new feedback on. Because I both developed and did the design I had the possibility of being able to design/change things directly in the code instead of taking the step to Sketch or Figma between which made the whole iteration process from feedback to updated prototype happen faster and more hands-on for me and the user.</p>"}},"slice_type":"rich_text"},{"id":"b0744cf9-363b-57eb-a9b9-bcf9b2135e21","slice_type":"full_width_image","internal":{"type":"PrismicProjectBodyFullWidthImage"},"primary":{"image":{"localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#e8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/eb65c/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.jpg","srcSet":"/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/7284f/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.jpg 750w,\n/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/29ba9/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.jpg 1080w,\n/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/eb65c/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.jpg 1350w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/57584/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.webp 750w,\n/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/984df/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.webp 1080w,\n/static/66cac94f3afa9443b1f158cac3927750/68172/3d1cdd5b-e9ba-40a7-a641-823a976f459a_photo-1532102235608-dc8fc689c9ab.webp 1350w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.6666666666666666}}}}}},{"id":"26a45844-623c-5dc5-ae58-5d302fd3863f","primary":{"text":{"html":"<h1>Iteration example</h1><h5>Feedback</h5><p><em>&quot;I do not think the prototype is serious, you only have 6 different treatments while the hairdressing salon I go to has 25.&quot;</em></p><h5>Analysis</h5><p>The hairdressing salons booking system has a treatment for 30min, 45min, and 60min based on hair length and sometimes even a male or female option.
