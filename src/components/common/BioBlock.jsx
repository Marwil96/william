            I were born in 1996 in a small town named <span data-bio-target='https://imengine.hall.infomaker.io/imengine/image.php?uuid=e267f9f7-17fd-4ced-8d7a-9a0a73ae1ae2&type=preview&source=false&function=hardcrop&width=1200&height=800&q=80https://gbghistoria.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/basarbron-utsikt-mot-kungstorget-1901.jpg?w=640'> Skara </span>, we haven't had the best couple of centuries. The highlight of the town were in 998 A.D when Olof Sk√∂tkonung became the first baptised Swedish king in a church in my hometown. 
            <br/><br/>Some things have changed since then. The town have been burned down three times by the danish, we were the meeting place for "Thing of all Geats"(1100 A.D - 1300 A.D rock festival), and in 2010 we got famous for having a cannibal "accident". When people grow up in places like that they often try to escape it.  My way of escaping were playing Pokemon Silver with my <span data-bio-target='http://i.imgur.com/h3JPeCc.jpg'>Gameboy color</span>. This  form of escape later turned into an pc and thats where my intrest for development started.
            <br/><br/>Now when you got a good sense of my origin we should probably continue. After spending my childhood in Skara I moved to <span data-bio-target='https://www.pro.se/Global/PRO%20riksorganisationen/PRO%2075/11699423-fontan-poseidon-i-goteborg.jpg?preset=ArticleMainImage'> Gothenburg </span> to start my education in Digital Design at <span data-bio-target='./assets/images/yrgo.jpg'>YRGO</span>. During my time in Gothenburg i learned about design on the days and development by the nights. After a while I started to do freelance work for organistations such as Hallands Region & Devolve digital. When my time at YRGO started to run its course I googled the term "Design Agency Netherlands" and found <span data-bio-target='https://d2zr9w65gdacs9.cloudfront.net/19631/momkai-homerun-photo-651520968169full-width.jpg'>Momkai</span> then I applied. I got in. Then I moved to Amsterdam.
