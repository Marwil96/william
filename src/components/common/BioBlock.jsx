            I were born in 1996 in a small town named <span data-bio-target='https://imengine.hall.infomaker.io/imengine/image.php?uuid=e267f9f7-17fd-4ced-8d7a-9a0a73ae1ae2&type=preview&source=false&function=hardcrop&width=1200&height=800&q=80https://gbghistoria.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/basarbron-utsikt-mot-kungstorget-1901.jpg?w=640'> Skara </span>, we haven't had the best couple of centuries. The highlight of the town were in 998 A.D when Olof Sk√∂tkonung became the first baptised Swedish king in a church in my hometown. 
            <br/><br/>Some things have changed since then. The town have been burned down three times by the danish, we were the meeting place for "Thing of all Geats"(1100 A.D - 1300 A.D rock festival), and in 2010 we got famous for having a cannibal "accident". As you can understand people that grow up in places like that often try to escape it.  My way of escaping were my computer and Pokemon Silver on my <span data-bio-target='http://i.imgur.com/h3JPeCc.jpg'>Gameboy color</span>. And thats where my interest for development started.
            <br/><br/>After spending my childhood in Skara I moved to <span data-bio-target={gothenburgImg}> Gothenburg </span> to start my education in Digital Design at <span data-bio-target='./assets/images/yrgo.jpg'>YRGO.</span> During my time in Gothenburg I learned about design on the days and development by the nights. After a while I started to do freelance work for organistations such as Hallands Region & Devolve digital. When my time at YRGO started to run its course I started working with <span data-bio-target={momkaiImg}>Momkai</span> in Amsterdam where I have worked for clients such as <span data-bio-target={knvbImg}>KNVB </span> and HVA.
