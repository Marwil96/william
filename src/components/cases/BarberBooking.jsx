                    <TextBlock label='Problem Research' text='I started the process by researching about the barber/hairdresser profession. My way of doing that were interviewing barbers and finding reports about the buisness on the internet.' />
                    <TextBlock label='General Information' text="In Sweden, 8500 hairdressing salons exist and they have an average of 3.8 employees. Which means that hairdressing salons are usually small businesses. 700kr is the average payment. 62% of Sweden's women dye their hair. Customers have great loyalty to their hairdresser, 54% of all men surveyed by LÂ´oreal have been with the same hairdresser for over two years. According to a British survey, the Brittish people trust their hairdresser more than their priest or police." />
                    <TextBlock label='Market Research' text='The biggest booking system that exists today is ItsPerfect. I made some test on the system both by clicking through it myself but also by letting three users do it in front of me.' />
                    <TextBlock label='Tech Research' text='I choosed to work in React because it is an componentbased framework and I have previous experience with it.' />
                    <TextBlock label='Testing Research' text='My mentor recommended me to use HotJar for digital testing as an complement to ordinary usertesting because it is easier to share and get an bigger testing group.' />

                    <TextBlock label='Userflow' text='I started sketching out which functions and views that were neccecery to make the product work. When that were done I wrote down the views on Post-Its and started creating userflows by moving the Post-Its around. By doing it this way I could easily get a feel of different userflows, example should the user pick barber or time first?' />

                    <TextBlock label='Development Thinking' text='The starting points were that the components were supposed to be multifunctional and have so little logic in them as possible. Because they needed to be as reusible as possible.' />
                    <TextBlock label='Iteration' text='With the help of the constant flow of feedback, I couldmake small changes quickly that I could later show again and get new feedback on. Because I both devloped and did the design I hadthe possibility of being able to design / change things directly in the code instead of taking the step to Sketch or Figma between which made the whole iteration process from feedback to updated prototype happen faster and more hands-on for me and the user.' />

                        <span>- Interactive illustration.
                        <br/>- Visually choose between short hair, long hair, shoulder long hair and long hair.
                        <br/>- Adjusts the price of treatments that cost more if you have longer hair.</span>
